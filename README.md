# activity-decomp
## Installation
1. Clone repository
2. If you don't have your ssh-key uploaded on github then you must first clone and pip install joints: https://github.com/JMU-Wearable-Computing/joints. The installation script will automatically do this for you, but since joints is a private repository it requires authentication-hence the ssh-key requirement. 
3. Pip install:
```
cd activity_decomp
pip install .
```
or if you want to edit the repository use `pip install -e .`. This allows the package to respond to edit made without re-installing.
